Poze: Private and Secure Identity Verification

# Inspiration
An increasingly common problem for sites is dealing with fake users, users impersonating other users, and enforcement of best security practices with users. This problem is so severe that [in 2018 Q4, Facebook recognized 118 Million impersonated accounts.][1] Facebook's solution is to ask users to [upload photos of government issued IDs](https://kmph.com/news/local/facebook-is-asking-people-to-submit-their-ids-to-prove-their-accounts-are-real). However, this is an imperfect solution. Firstly, government IDs are quite easy to fake in real life, yet alone in an image. And secondly, users may be understandably worried uploading images of personally identifiable documents to Facebook and other sites. Our goal was to create a method to verify identities of users without requireing any personally identifiable documents. 

# What it does
Poze is an API that asks users to do simple tasks on camera and will use Computer Vision to verify that they are accomplishing the task as designed and verifying that the person on camera is the correct owner of the account. When given an image of the user, Poze verifies that the person in the video is the person in the user's image. Therfore verifying that the person in control of the account is the person in control of the likeness displayed on the account.
